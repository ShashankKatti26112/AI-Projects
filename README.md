Here are some simple explanations of AI projects:

1. Image Classification
Imagine you have a lot of pictures and you want to sort them into categories, like "cats" or "dogs". A computer can do this for you using a special program that looks at the pictures and decides which category they belong to. This is called image classification.

2. Sentiment Analysis
Have you ever written a review of a restaurant or movie? A computer can read your review and decide whether you liked it or not. This is called sentiment analysis. The computer can look at the words you used and decide if they're positive (good) or negative (bad).
